Objectives:
Measure agent efficiency based on call handling time, resolution rate, and customer satisfaction.

Identify peak call hours and analyze wait times and drop-off rates.

Track First Call Resolution (FCR) and Escalation Rates.

Determine customer sentiment from survey feedback and call logs.

Create dashboards to monitor performance trends in real-time.
